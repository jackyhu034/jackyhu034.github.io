I am a electrical engineer major at CSUF and I plan to graduate in 2028. 

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

Lab 01 

This was a really fun lab, especially since this was the first lab I had ever done in College. It truly showed me the introduction into coding and editing. I had a lot to learn from this lab since it was my first time using all of these new codes that I learned in my discussion class. 

Lab 7

This was my favorite lab to do because I really liked working with the different dates and times that someone could park in the parking areas on the side curb. It was really tricky finding the code to get it correct but I really enjoyed finding out the problems. This was probably the most tricky lab that I have done so far, from the first lab till lab 12. 

Lab 2

After learning how to work VS code and terminal, Lab 2 felt a lot easier than Lab 1 since I didnâ€™t need to learn how to work the codes anymore. I was a lot more comfortable with this lab since I was more familiar with the work. There was obviously more to learn but I still enjoyed the lab and reading the notes and steps on how to complete it. I remember asking for help and it really helped me understand how to use the code and why the certain code was used.
